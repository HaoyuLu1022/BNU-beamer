# BNU-beamer

## Overview

This is a beamer template modified based on Metropolis theme. As the developer of the original Metropolis theme wrote, and I quote here

>   Metropolis is a simple, modern Beamer theme suitable for anyone to use. It tries
>   to minimize noise and maximize space for content; the only visual flourish it
>   offers is an (optional) progress bar added to each slide. The core design
>   principles of the theme were described in a blog post
>   [here](http://bloerg.net/2014/09/20/a-modern-beamer-theme.html).

The modifications include: 

-   Primary theme color changed to BNU-Blue (师大蓝)
-   Logo with high-resolution imported. Many thanks to [LeyuDame](https://github.com/LeyuDame) for open-sourcing the high-res logo and corresponding Tikz code
-   Frequently used packages added to the `beamerthememetropolis.sty` file (based on personal preferences)

For a minimal example, please refer to `main.tex` and `main.pdf`. Compilation has been tested on WSL 2 (Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS) with TexLive 2022.
